# project_euler
My solutions for Project Euler problems from 1-100. Updating daily until I solve them all!

## Things I'm using
| Things  | How it helps |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| BigNumber by Limeoats      | Since C++ doesn't natively support super big numbers, [this](https://github.com/Limeoats/BigNumber) library is useful!     |

## Solutions I didn't post
If you notice a missing solution, here's why:
| Problem  | Explanation |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 011      | I acutally found the answer just by looking at the grid.     |
| 017      | I solved this problem previously, and didn't feel like resolving it because it is more tedious than anything.     |
| 019      | I used Java's Date API for this, and I wanted to keep this repository C++ only.     |
| 033      | If you know about anomalous cancellation, chances are you already know these four fractions already.      |
